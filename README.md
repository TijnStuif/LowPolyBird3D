# Bootcamp Bird Assignment

For this assignment you will have to make a 3D version of the game '[Flappy Bird](https://flappybird.io/)'. The issue board of this project desbribes the steps you will need to complete. Some steps are labeled as bonus.

- Update the state of the issues, so we can clearly see what you did and did not implement.
- Commit all the code in the repository of this project.
- Make at least one commit per issue.
- The commit messages should clearly describe what changes were made. You can reference the issues in your messages.
- Make sure your game is published to Itch.io, even when you're not finished at the end of the bootcamp.
